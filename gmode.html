        <p class="p1">Battle royale may be the most popular mode in Garena Free Fire, but there’s more to the game than just the main format. From 4v4 competitive action to a 1v1 duel to the death, there are multiple ways to play, as well as a ton of custom maps and modes to enjoy. See below for the many possibilities when it comes to playing Free Fire, and maybe try something different the next time you log in.

            <h3 class="line6">Battle Royale/BR Ranked
            </h3>
              <p class="p6"> The main mode of Free Fire is its battle royale, where 50 players drop onto an island and the winner is the last one standing. Each match offers a unique experience thanks to different maps, locations, and gear found while on the ground, but the core objective is the same: Stay in the safe zone, eliminate opponents, and earn the Booyah at the end.

            </h3> 
            <p class="p2">
              If you’re seeking something more collaborative, then check out Clash Squad, which is a four-on-four round-based mode where the last team standing wins. Purchase more powerful weapons between rounds with an in-game budget that increases depending on how well you performed in the previous round.

            <h3 class="line3">Craftland</h3> 
            <p class="p3">Craftland is Free Fire's creative sandbox, where you can build and share maps, modes, and more. Simply open the Craftland menu, find a game that looks interesting to you, and try it out. If you're having trouble deciding, use the Craftland Maps option on the modes menu to select a random experience and jump right into a game with no hassle.

            <h3 class="line4">Lone Wolf
            </h3> 
            <p class="p4">
              Lone Wolf is the duelist's dream – one-on-one, no distractions, just two players trying to best each other in combat. Every two rounds, one player will choose which weapon each combatant will use, and the first player to win five rounds will win the game. This mode is for those who want to test their pure combat skills.

            </h3> 
            <p class="p5">
              In addition to the ongoing ways to play, there are also two rotating slots with random game modes, each of which offers a different take on the Free Fire experience. A few examples include “Big Head” mode, a free-for-all deathmatch, and a zombie invasion mode where teams must defeat hordes of the undead.
